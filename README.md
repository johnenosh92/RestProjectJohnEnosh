# Rest Project JohnEnosh
## This is a Rest Sample project that handles all HTTP requests which is developed using nodeJS.

Assuming npm is installed on your computer, please run the command "node server" in the command prompt or terminal by having the CURRENT DIRECTORY as the project folder where the server.js file is.

Go to POSTMAN and do a GET REQUEST on the url: http:localhost:3000/ to be routed to the home page which has the information of all other endpoints and how to use them.
